## ACE certification 

[Google Cloud Certification](https://cloud.google.com/certification){:target="_blank"} are classified into foundational, associate, and professional according to their level. The Associate Cloud Engineer(ACE) certification can be a good starting point for studying overall GCP cloud technologies to obtain advanced professional certifications, including network, security, machine learning, etc. As of January 2022, about 13,200 people shared their [ACE certification](https://googlecloudcertified.credential.net/){:target="_blank"} in LinkedIn, and it keeps growing.  

The 3 biggest companies in cloud market are Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), and Google (GCP). Amazon has overwhelmingly occupied the cloud market as it entered the IaaS(Infra as a Service) market faster than other companies in 2006. Google launched Google Compute Engine in 2012 and took a later step in the IaaS market than other companies. However, it has various PaaS(Platform as a service) by focusing on data analysis technology and artificial intelligence. Starting with App Engine in 2008, BigQuery services were launched in 2010. 

Each cloud company has different strengths, so many companies are actually building a multi-cloud environment that mixes two or more cloud services. For example, even if infrastructures are provided from AWSâ€™ cloud services, data analysis and artificial intelligence development can be supported by GCP. With the spread of multi-cloud and the importance of corporate data analysis and processing capabilities, it will be a good choice to prepare for ACE certifications. 

## Review of the Exam

The most important thing to prepare for exam was to take the [Udemy-Google Association Cloud Engineer Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-certified-associate-cloud-engineer-practice-exams-gcp/){:target="_blank"}. I studied wrong answers with the help of [GCP theoretical lecture](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-certification-associate-cloud-engineer/){:target="_blank"}, organized my studies on one page of OneNote, and reviewed it just before the test. I also recommend to get hands-on experience with GCP products. If you sign up for GCP, you will get a free credit worth $300.  With it, you can select contents in [Catalog](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog){:target="_blank"}, and get hands-on experience of GCP.

According to the [online proctored exam requirements](https://support.google.com/cloud-certification/answer/9907748?hl=en&ref_topic=9433463){:target="_blank"}, I was worried about paper and pens could not be used, but there were no major difficulties on the day of the test. Finally, I obtained a Google Cloud Certified Association Cloud Engineer certifications, which was one of my first goals after getting a job. I encouraged many people who want to be a cloud engineer to develop cloud computing skills through GCP ACE certification.
